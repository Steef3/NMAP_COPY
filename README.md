IMPORTANT NOTE:
Right now, the program is optimized for testing and not for usage.


# pythonmap
This program's functionalities are based on nmap.
Help is always appreciated!

## General stuff
This program is written in Python 3 and not Python 2.
Any ideas for additional features, any fixes to any of the infinite problems that are listed at the top of the main file or anything else will be helpful, thank you!

### Windows
In order to use hardcore mode (i.e. scapy module), you need winpcap installed.

### Mac OS
I am rarely doing testing, but if I do, it's on Mac OS, for now.
Ok to tell the truth, most of my time is invested in testing.

## Files explained
### Port_Scan.py
This is the main program. Run this.
### modules_to_install
These modules are required to run the program. Run this to install all modules at once.
### ports.txt
This is a list of ports that can be used to define which ports to scan.
### ips.txt
This is a list of ips that can be used to define which ip addresses to scan.
### name-main_check.py
This is just a program that calls a function within Port_Scan.py. This should not be possible.
